                    <h1>How did I get here?</h1>
                    <p>After school, university, a masters, and the best part of ten years working in HR I was introduced to coaching. At the time, I was working in a HR management role in advertising (which I still do part-time). I did some research and
                        attended a weekend conference in London where I had my ‘aha’ moment. I signed up to do two diplomas (Personal Performance, and Corporate and Executive) and less than a year later I qualified!</p>

        <div class="row row-two">
            <p>Why do I focus on career and wellness coaching? The first one might be an easy assumption, having worked in HR it is an area I have a lot of knowledge and experience in, but having also not known where I want to be ‘long-term’ and so many
                friends hitting the ‘career rut’ – it was a no-brainer! Aside from that, I love being a coach and I want to help people find what they love to do too. <br><br><br> And wellness? Well, having come close to burnout in 2016, despite thinking
                I had a grip on my work-life balance and being reasonably healthy, I’ve realised that it’s so easy to mis-calculate your own expectations of yourself. That’s why for me it is so important to make sure everyone knows and understands their
                own definition of balance and wellness. This can mean a big shift, or a small one, depending on you and what you want. I’m still experimenting with mine, and it’s a journey I love every day. For me, my happy place is when I am out on an
                early morning run.</p>

                <h1>My coaching style</h1>
                <p>
                    As a person I am very driven, honest, and I am known to like a plan! Although I am described as quite measured, my approach is tailored to each person. I see coaching as working in partnership, you don’t need to work on your goals alone. I will support
                    you, remind you of your progress and celebrate your success. <br><br> Is this sounding a bit too positive? What about, you know, life? I understand that everyone has other things going on, so we will balance the
                    realities of the day-to-day, so that you can remain focused on your journey. As long as you are 100% committed to the coaching process, good things will happen. Together we will help you find fulfilment and be the best version of yourself.
                    <br><br> Who do I like to work with? Over the last ten years working in HR and coaching I have worked in retail, advertising and executive search with many different people. My coaching experience lies at middle and senior management
                    level as well as 1-2-1 private clients of differing ages, careers, and goals.</p>
