          you know what it is that you want, but you can’t quite work out how to get there. There is only so much help we can get over a cup of coffee (or a glass of wine) from friends, family, colleagues. When we don’t know what we want, or we are unsure
          of the steps, how are we meant to find our way? <em>What on earth are we meant to do?</em> Stay as we are, because that’s probably easier, right?<br><br> You are not alone - you can choose to work with a Coach. Why? People choose to work with
          a Coach because they are proactive and want change. Whether it’s to get more clarity, to develop skills, or to enhance their own personal learning and awareness. Interested?

            <ul class="menu vertical nested">
              <p>Coaching is all about development. We will work together to help you improve in particular areas, learn new skills, find personal success, achieve goals and to manage change and personal challenges. In the coaching process you are asked
                purposeful questions and we work through different tools and techniques, so that you can develop a number of options and make your own decision about the best way forward.

 <span>+</span></a>
            <ul class="menu vertical nested">
              <p>No. While coaching has some similarities to other psychological interventions, therapy (counselling) is used for different reasons and in different situations.

            </ul>

 <span>+</span></a>
            <ul class="menu vertical nested">
              <p>A typical coaching session will involve me asking you questions, and listening to you in a totally confidential and non-judgemental environment. We work together to challenge your current way of thinking so that you can find the answers
                and the steps to take to make sure you feel fulfilled and content with your goals.

   <span>+</span></a>
            <ul class="menu vertical nested">
              <p class="questions-two-right">Because, quite simply, sometimes we all just need a bit of help - and that’s nothing to be ashamed of! As a Coach I am qualified to ask you challenging questions to get you to think beyond your own personal limitations.
                <br><br> As your Coach I will also be your sounding board. I will offer you a neutral and objective perspective to help you realize your potential. I will give you support and encouragement all of the way. Remember, the most important
                part of the puzzle is you! Because YOU must be committed to taking some action and to sometimes make changes. This can be hard, but I will be with you all the way..

              <p class="questions-two-right">People who maybe feel a bit lost and who are ready for a change. People who want to feel excited again about work, or life, who’ve lost their enthusiasm but are not sure what will give them that buzz, or even how to make it happen.. essentially
                - everyone! There are no limits. <br><br> Most of the time, the people who work with me are those who want to invest time in themselves. This is because they are proactive in their approach to life, they are looking for greater fulfilment,
                and they are committed to doing the tasks necessary to get them there – whether it be with relationships, career, finances, or health, to name a few.

              <p class="questions-two-right">It can be done 1-2-1 in person (London), or over the phone or Skype. Sessions can last anything from 30 minutes to 90 minutes, and happen weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. Depending on what you need and what your preferences are, we will
                agree all of this before starting. Coaching is not a quick fix – it is quite usual for us to work together for a minimum period of 3 months.

        <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-6 columns wellness">
          <p>What does career coaching mean? Well, simply-put, it is the coaching process but focusing on your work-life. It covers a number of areas such as career development and purpose.<br><br> So many of us feel stuck, confused, or unfulfilled in our
            roles at one point or another. If I ask you now: “what are your goals and aspirations in relation to your career?” What would your answer be? What are the reasons behind your answer?<br><br>Career coaching is one of the best ways to get clarity,
            to find the answers, and to then look at how to make change happen. Everyone needs to have a sense of direction and that will come when you know what it is that you want to achieve!<br><br> Sometimes you will get the clarity you need from
            3 or 4 sessions, others may need 6+ sessions. This will depend on you and what you want. No matter the number of sessions you want, I will be there to positively challenge you, set goals that motivate and inspire you, run through tools and
            techniques to turn it into a reality, and support you along the way so you can take the necessary steps forward.<br><br> Examples of some topics in this are: Decision making – Confidence - Presentation skills - Relationship challenges - Dealing
            with change - Team work/collaboration - Career planning - Getting out of a rut</p>

        <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-6 columns wellness">
          <p>For me, when someone says “You look well” – that is a massive compliment. Because for me, it means I look happy, healthy, and like I have everything sorted. But looking and feeling well are very different. <br><br>What does the word ‘wellness’
            mean to you? What is the difference between ‘wellness’ and ‘wellbeing’? Wellness = prevention, and health. Wellbeing = happiness, fulfilment and satisfaction. <br><br>The importance of both concepts is increasing each year in a constantly
            ‘on’ world. But, thankfully, we are also recognising the need to look after ourselves, and the self-care revolution is growing every month. Sometimes, though, we just need some help to focus on this. To change our mindsets and make time for
            good old ‘me’. <br><br>Within wellness coaching is also life coaching, or personal development coaching. If you have something in mind that you want to work on, improve or change then coaching is the BEST place to begin. You deserve to focus
            on you, put yourself first, and be the best version of yourself!<br><br>Some examples of the areas that coaching covers are: General well-being – Resilience – Mindfulness - Work-life balance - Managing stress - Personal development -Habit
            change/evolution - Addressing limiting beliefs – Transformation - Confidence and self-worth – Energy – Resetting your compass</p>

          <p>As well as offering 1-2-1 coaching to individuals, I also work with companies to do 1-2-1 coaching, workshops, and programmes. These are tailored to your needs and are therefore bespoke. <br><br>Having qualified in both personal and corporate
            coaching, I am certified to coach across all areas you have in mind! Workshops can be done on an educational level, or carried out as a team coaching session. These different sessions are organised to encourage shared learning, and to promote
            both personal and professional success. As well as carrying out in-house workshops, I put together programmes to suit your needs to ensure you have a happy, engaged and productive workforce. <br><br>Some examples include: leadership and management

          <p>Skimming past school – university - a masters etc, I have spent the best part of ten years working in HR when I was introduced to coaching. Fast-forward another year and I qualified with two diplomas: Personal Performance Coaching, and Corporate

                <p><span><img src="images/left-quote.png" alt=""></span>The coaching I received from Charlotte helped me to overcome some key challenges that I had been facing professionally over the past few years. Charlotte was an excellent Coach and ensured
                  that we made the best use of each coaching session. Through listening to my descriptions of key challenges I was hoping to overcome Charlotte helped to break down these challenges and find practical ways to tackle them. The results were
                  immediate; Charlotte clearly has a wide experience of tools and techniques which help to change behaviour. Therefore, after each coaching session I was able to immediately make small changes which led to big results. It is good to know
                  how coaching can help me in the future as I will definitely contact Charlotte in future when the need arises.<span><img src="images/right-quote.png" alt=""></span>

                  in the direction I wanted to take and the actions that would get me there. She has an extremely calming, friendly and professional approach to her sessions, which gave me the confidence to discuss things that I may not normally discuss
                  with anyone else. She has been a great sounding board at times when I needed to voice things I had in my head. I know that in the future I’ll need someone to turn to help gain further clarity in the journey that is life, and Charlotte
                  will be the person and Coach I know I could turn to in order to achieve this.<span><img src="images/right-quote.png" alt=""></span>
