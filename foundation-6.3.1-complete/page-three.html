</h5>
                    <p>Skimming past school – university - a masters etc, I have spent the best part of ten years working in HR when I was introduced to coaching. Fast-forward another year and I qualified with two diplomas: Personal Performance Coaching,
                        and Corporate and Executive Coaching. <br><br> Having worked in HR across the creative sector, with a focus on L&amp;D and wellbeing, I have knowledge and experience in these areas, and more importantly, I feel passionate about
                        them! Coaching is the way that I can use my passion and invest it into a role where I can help others find what they love to do too. <br><br> Still reading? A few more things that you might find interesting about me..</p>

                                    the best use of each coaching session. Through listening to my descriptions of key challenges I was hoping to overcome Charlotte helped to break down these challenges and find practical ways to tackle them. The results
                                    were immediate; Charlotte clearly has a wide experience of tools and techniques which help to change behaviour. Therefore, after each coaching session I was able to immediately make small changes which led to big results.
                                    It is good to know how coaching can help me in the future as I will definitely contact Charlotte in future when the need arises.<span>&rdquo;</span>

                    <!-- <p>Why do I focus on career and wellness coaching? The first one might be an easy assumption, having worked in HR it is an area I have a lot of knowledge and experience in, but having also not known where I want to be ‘long-term’ and
                                        so many friends hitting the ‘career rut’ – it was a no-brainer! Aside from that, I love being a coach and I want to help people find what they love to do too. <br><br /> And wellness? Well, having come close to burnout in 2016,
                                        despite thinking I had a grip on my work-life balance and being reasonably healthy, I’ve realised that it’s so easy to mis-calculate your own expectations of yourself. That’s why for me it is so important to make sure everyone
                                        knows and understands their own definition of balance and wellness. This can mean a big shift, or a small one, depending on you and what you want. I’m still experimenting with mine, and it’s a journey I love every day. For me,
                                        my happy place is when I am out on an early morning run.</p> -->

                                    with anyone else. She has been a great sounding board at times when I needed to voice things I had in my head. I know that in the future I’ll need someone to turn to help gain further clarity in the journey that is
                                    life, and Charlotte will be the person and Coach I know I could turn to in order to achieve this.<span>&rdquo;</span>
