                            <p>Coaching is all about development. As your Coach I help you to improve in particular areas, learn new skills, find personal success, achieve goals and to manage change and personal challenges. This is done by asking you purposeful
                                questions and working through different tools and techniques, but there’s no suggestions or advice!

                            <p>No! While coaching has some similarities to other psychological interventions, therapy (counselling) is used for different reasons and in different situations.

                            <p>A typical coaching session will involve me asking you questions, and listening to you in a totally confidential and non-judgemental environment. We work together to challenge your current way of thinking so that you can find
                                the answers and the steps to take to make sure you feel fulfilled and content with your goals.

                            <p>Because, quite simply, sometimes we all just need a bit of help - and that’s nothing to be ashamed of! As a Coach I am qualified to ask you challenging questions to get you to think beyond your own personal limitations.
                                <br><br> As your Coach I will also be your sounding board. I will offer you a neutral and objective perspective to help you realize your potential. I will give you support and encouragement all of the way. Remember, the
                                most important part of the puzzle is you! Because YOU must be committed to taking some action and to sometimes make changes. This can be hard, but I will be with you all the way..

                            <p>People who maybe feel a bit lost and who are ready for a change. People who want to feel excited again about work, or life, who’ve lost their enthusiasm but are not sure what will give them that buzz, or even how to make it
                                happen.. essentially - everyone! There are no limits. <br><br> Most of the time, the people who work with me are those who want to invest time in themselves. This is because they are proactive in their approach to life,
                                they are looking for greater fulfilment, and they are committed to doing the tasks necessary to get them there – whether it be with relationships, career, finances, or health, to name a few.

                            <p>It can be done 1-2-1 in person (London), or over the phone or Skype. Sessions can last anything from 30 minutes to 90 minutes, and happen weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. Depending on what you need and what your preferences
                                are, we will agree all of this before starting. Coaching is not a quick fix – it is quite usual for us to work together for a minimum period of 3 months.

                    <p>What does career coaching mean? Well, simply-put, it is the coaching process but focusing on your work-life. It covers a number of areas such as career development and purpose.<br><br> So many of us feel stuck, confused, or unfulfilled
                        in our roles at one point or another. If I ask you now: “what are your goals and aspirations in relation to your career?” What would your answer be? What are the reasons behind your answer?<br><br>Career coaching is one of the
                        best ways to get clarity, to find the answers, and to then look at how to make change happen. Everyone needs to have a sense of direction and that will come when you know what it is that you want to achieve!<br><br> Sometimes you
                        will get the clarity you need from 3 or 4 sessions, others may need 6+ sessions. This will depend on you and what you want. No matter the number of sessions you want, I will be there to positively challenge you, set goals that
                        motivate and inspire you, run through tools and techniques to turn it into a reality, and support you along the way so you can take the necessary steps forward.<br><br> Examples of some topics in this are: Decision making – Confidence
                        - Presentation skills - Relationship challenges - Dealing with change - Team work/collaboration - Career planning - Getting out of a rut</p>

                    <p>For me, when someone says “You look well” – that is a massive compliment. Because for me, it means I look happy, healthy, and like I have all my sh*t together. But looking and feeling well are very different. <br><br>What does the
                        word ‘wellness’ mean to you? What is the difference between ‘wellness’ and ‘wellbeing’? Wellness = prevention, and health. Wellbeing = happiness, fulfilment and satisfaction. <br><br>The importance of both concepts is increasing
                        each year in a constantly ‘on’ world. But, thankfully, we are also recognising the need to look after ourselves, and the self-care revolution is growing every month. Sometimes, though, we just need some help to focus on this. To
                        change our mindsets and make time for good old ‘me’. <br><br>Within wellness coaching is also life coaching, or personal development coaching. If you have something in mind that you want to work on, improve or change then coaching
                        is the BEST place to begin. You deserve to focus on you, put yourself first, and be the best version of yourself!<br><br> Some examples of the areas that coaching covers are: General well-being – Resilience – Mindfulness - Work-life
                        balance - Managing stress - Personal development -Habit change/evolution - Addressing limiting beliefs – Transformation - Confidence and self-worth – Energy – Resetting your compass</p>
